# File Reader Worker

Just a very simple example to showcase how you can interact with Web Workers, and delegate tasks like reading Files.

Also in this repo I have 2 examples on how you do this in an **asynchronous** or **synchronous** way.

# How to run

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

 check your console!
